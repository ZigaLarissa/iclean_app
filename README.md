iClean is a python program that will make its users aware and knowledgeable about the environment, hence encouraging them to take action to conserve it. The user will be acquiring knowledge and having fun at the same time.Here is how it will work.

*iClean will provide one piece of information daily to its users.The piece of information will be about climate change, air pollution, biodiversity and ecosystem, agriculture and environment,etc. of different places around the globe.

*This piece of information will be in the form of quotes,facts,updates,discoveries,etc.
*This program will provide one new piece of information every day and ask the user to share it on his/her social media platforms after being installed.
*After receiving this piece of information the user will have to choose the correct answer to the question related to the environment.
*Depending on the user’s performance he/she will be receiving stars for getting the questions right and will be promoted in ranks from soldier,officer,...,to general,Marshal.

To achieve this functionality for our program we will implement the  features/functions described below.

*A function that will introduce the app, the policies,rules and the guidelines,and finally the mission of the app.
*A function that will create an account for the user when given a user name and linked to any user’s account on facebook,twitter,etc.
*A function that will drop a new piece of information on the user’s device daily.
*A function that will drop a question everyday after the information has been provided and four proposed answers in which one is the most accurate,with an option to choose one correct answer
*A function to check if the choice is right.
*A function that will display the correct answer
*A function that will provide a star to the User for any right choices he/she makes.
*A function that will count the number of stars acquired by the users and classify users in ranks according to the stars they acquire. 
*A function that keeps track of the user's progress.
*The main function where all the functions will be called in order of execution.
